    <p>Inspired from a present my son gave me for Christmas of 2024, which consistent of a container filled with pieces of paper with a They Might Be Giants song written on it.  <a href="archive.html">Every day of 2024</a>, I got to pull a new song out of the "hat".  Now that 2024 is over, and my container full of songs is empty, I am putting together a bot to do the same thing for the people of BlueSky.</p>
